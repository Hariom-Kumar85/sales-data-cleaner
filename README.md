# Sales Data Cleaner

## Project Title & Goal  
A simple Python script that cleans messy sales data from a CSV file and converts it into a clean JSON report.

---

## Setup Instructions  
Run the project using:

python main.py
This will generate the output file clean_sales.json.

The Logic (How I thought)
I read the CSV file using Python’s csv module, cleaned the price values by removing $ and quotes, converted USD to INR, and removed duplicate records using a set.

Output Screenshots

Future Improvements
Add better error handling

Allow custom input/output file names

Handle larger datasets
